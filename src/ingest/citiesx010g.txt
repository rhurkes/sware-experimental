    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer includes cities and towns in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
        Islands.  A city or town is a place with a recorded population, usually with at least one central 
        area that provides commercial activities.  Cities are generally larger than towns; no distinction 
        is made between cities and towns in this map layer.  
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
        States in the use of these data.
      Supplemental_Information:
        Version 1 of this data set was produced from GNIS and Census data in 2012 but was not released.  
        This data set replaces the earlier version.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The data sets were all loaded into ArcGIS.  The GNIS data are considered the most authoritative 
          source, and the Census data are considered the next most authoritative source.

          The 2M_Cities and GNIS data were compared.  Cities that were included in both sources were 
          identified and added to the data set, using the location from GNIS.

          The 2010Census_Gazetteer and GNIS data were compared.  Cities that were included in both sources 
          were identified and added to the data set, using the location from GNIS.  

          The 2010Census_Gazetteer and 2M_Cities data were compared.  Cities that were included in both 
          sources but that were not in GNIS were added to the data set, using the location from 
          2010Census_Gazetteer.

          The result was a file that included all the cities and towns from 2010Census_Gazetteer, as well 
          as some other cities and towns.  If there was a GNIS position available, that was used; if no 
          GNIS position was available the Census position was used.

          Attribute fields were updated as necessary.  The attribute GNIS_ID was added from GNIS to 
          identify all populated places and any other cities or towns that were in GNIS.  The attribute 
          ANSICODE was added to all cities or towns that were in the 2010Census_Gazetteer; included are 
          most of the cities designated as "census" or "civil" in GNIS.  There are some "census" and 
          "civil" points in GNIS that are not in 2010Census_Gazetteer; for these locations the ANSICODE was 
          set to -999.  Locations that came from sources other than GNIS or 2010Census_Gazetteer have a 
          value of -999 for both GNIS_ID and ANSICODE.  Some elevation values were added from topographic 
          map sources.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          City and town names from GNIS were modified to remove the feature type from the name; the 
          resulting name was used for all features taken from GNIS.  For features that came from 
          2010Census_Gazetteer, the Census name was used.  Remaining names were taken from the State base 
          maps, topographic maps, or State highway maps.  Name discrepancies were sent to the GNIS and were 
          resolved by their personnel.

          Some features are included in GNIS both as "populated places" and as "census" or "civil" feature 
          types.  Duplicate features were identified and the "populated places" were deleted from the data.

          Population data were added to the file from 2010Census_Gazetteer.

          A final quality-control review was done and some city locations and names were adjusted based on 
          information from State Base Maps 1:500K, USA Topo Maps Map Service 100K, and Official State 
          Highway Maps.
